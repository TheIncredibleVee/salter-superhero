By default there is a list of 20 heroes and you can click the name to find their power stats. On searching you will get the data as requested if it exists and clicking on the search button on the right again will bring the list of 20 heroes back.

Tech Stack (Frameworks and Libraries used): React.js, Tailwind CSS, Axios, React-Chart.js, framer-motion, gh-pages.

PS. When I sent you the email where the API wasn't working, I found a similar API on RapidAPI( https://rapidapi.com/jakash1997/api/superhero-search ) and have used this API in the project.
